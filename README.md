The website displays a list of photos, which are separated in several categories - Nature, City, Animals and People. Also, the site offers the possibility for displaying all of the images.

When a person clicks on an image, it opens the image via Lightbox function. They can close the image by clicking anywhere besides the image. Also, when a person hovers over an image, there is a scale effect on it. 

The website also changes its layout depending on wheather or not a person views it on a smartphone or on a desktop / landscape view.
